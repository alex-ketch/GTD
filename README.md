This site/book uses [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io) to compile and build the site.

If you'd like to contribute or see how it works clone this branch, open terminal window inside the working directory, and run the following commands.
  1. `npm install`
  2. `node build`

Please note that this requires you to have NPM and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, which you can easily find out how to yourself.

Things will be in flux for the immediate future as I figure out the optimal arrangement of the writing and build process, but it is my goal to have an ebook to go along with the web version as well.
